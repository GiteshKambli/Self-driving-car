# Self-driving-car
A minimalistic self dirving car model built using PyTorch

- The car and the environment is built using kivy.
- The car har 3 sensors which measures it's distance from the obstacles.
- The readings of the three sensors are passed to the Deep-Q Network which predicts the direction in which the car will move.
- The Deep-Q Network has 5 dense layers
